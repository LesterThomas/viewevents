===========

This application is to view events from my house (Currently generated by the https://github.com/LesterThomas/NodeRed-flows/tree/master/Query%20BT%20router%20for%20registered%20people%20(inc%20Sonos%20welcome%20and%20Tannoy)#query-bt-router-for-registered-people-inc-sonos-welcome-and-tannoy flow).




App to View Home Automation Events from the home_automation database
====================================================================

This application is a partner to the Node-Red application https://github.com/LesterThomas/NodeRed-flows/tree/master/Query%20BT%20router%20for%20registered%20people%20(inc%20Sonos%20welcome%20and%20Tannoy)

At the moment, it just displays some static HTML and has a proxy to the home-automation database.

The application skeleton was generated using Yeoman `yo express-simple`

To run the server, open two command windows:
- in the first type `grunt`. This monitors the files and re-builds if necessary.
- in the second, type `nodemon -L --debug app.js`. This runs the server application.


The database proxy is to the Cloudant database on Bluemix. Any URL's with /db/ will create a proxy to the database at https://40a04e93-daf4-47c7-9faa-f25334792d10-bluemix.cloudant.com/home-automation/

The format of the database document is:

```
{"_id":"event:1418052294542",
	"_rev":"1-42345b422221a08b2842ec3a2e34804c",
	"Name":"Kate",
	"Message":"Unregistered"}
```

The event id is a Javascript `Date.Now()` timestamp.

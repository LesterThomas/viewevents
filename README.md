View Events
===========

This application is to view events from my house (Currently generated by the https://github.com/LesterThomas/NodeRed-flows/tree/master/Query%20BT%20router%20for%20registered%20people%20(inc%20Sonos%20welcome%20and%20Tannoy)#query-bt-router-for-registered-people-inc-sonos-welcome-and-tannoy flow).

To run the server, open two command windows:
- in the first type `grunt`. This monitors the files and re-builds if necessary.
- in the second, type `nodemon -L --debug app.js`. This runs the server application.
